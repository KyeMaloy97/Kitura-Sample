**Sample application for Kitura Web Framework**

## Summary


This [Kitura](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura/) sample shows off the powerful features available in Kitura 2, baking several demos into one project. You can access the individual examples by navigating to their specific routes in a browser.


It features the following:

* Kitura WebSocket based chat server
* Stencil template engine example
* Using multiple handlers per route
* Reading and accepting parameters in a route


## Getting Set Up

1. Install the [prerequisites]( http://www.kitura.io/en/starter/settingup.html) (ignore the requirement to install Homebrew on macOS as it is not required for this sample).

2. `git clone https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-Sample.git && cd Kitura-Sample`
> Note: do not use the GitHub "Download ZIP" button

3. `swift build`

4. `./.build/debug/Kitura-Sample`

  You should see a message _Listening on port 8080_. You may need to click "Allow" if a security pop up appears, dependent on your firewall settings.

5. Open your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

6. Navigate to one of the example routes on the localhost URL, for example, for the chat server go to [localhost:8080/chat](localhost:8080/chat).

## Available Examples
### Kitura WebSocket
> Route: [localhost:8080/chat](localhost:8080/chat)

This demo sets up a local chat server using [Kitura's WebSocket](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-WebSocket/) library, and the UI mimicks a chat room. Two separate browser windows pointed to the `/chat` route can be used to represent two people in the chat room if the project is running on localhost. It can also be deployed to the [IBM Cloud](https://bluemix.net) and then accessed via a Cloud Foundry App.

### Swift JSON Web Tokens

> Route: [localhost:8080/login](localhost:8080/login)

A simple demo showing how a login page can generate a JSON Web Token for authentication of a user. After a successful login a token is generated and saved in the session storage of the browser. This can be viewed under Storage in the developer settings.

After token generation, the JWT is displayed in the browser window as both the base 64 encoded String and as a printed Swift JWT object. A link on this page fails is a user isn't logged in or if the JWT is expired, tampered with or is otherwise invalid.

See http://jwt.io for more information. Further reading on the JWT Web Standard (RFC 7519) can be found [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).

### Stencil Templating Engine
> Route: [localhost:8080/articles](localhost:8080/articles)

Kitura supports the popular Stencil Templating Engine, using the [Kitura Stencil](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-StencilTemplateEngine/) library. This route looks for a Stencil file in a subdirectory called `Views` and renders the page with it.

### Multiple Handlers in one Route
> Route: [localhost:8080/multi](localhost:8080/multi)

[Kitura](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura) supports multiple handlers per route, this example prints several lines to the window using different `response.send()` methods.

### Reading and Accepting Parameters
> Route: [localhost:8080/users/:user](localhost:8080/users/:user)

**Note:** This example uses `:users` but you can use anything you like, as long as the first part of the route is `/users/`.

This route accepts a parameter in its URL and uses that parameter in its HTML creation. It does this using a colon (:) in the URL which defines the item following it as a parameter. It then assigns this parameter to a variable, and concatenates it into the HTML.


## Testing
To invoke the tests locally, run `swift test` from the Kitura-Sample directory.

## Running in Xcode

You can also run this sample application inside Xcode. For more details, visit [kitura.io](http://www.kitura.io/en/starter/xcode.html).
